# [The Error Component](Error.tsx)

**Renders an error message into the modal. It can be passed either an object with a message property or a message string, and will display that message with the word "Error:" and some styling to let the user know it's an error.**

Note that if you want to render the error as a modal, you should use the [ErrorAlert](./ErrorAlert.tsx) component instead, which works the same way.
