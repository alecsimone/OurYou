# [Functional Icon](FunctionalIcon/FunctionalIcon.tsx)

**Provides a wrapper for our icons so we can easily give them all the functionality we need without having to apply it individually to each of them.**

Note that this component takes a child and renders it inside an svg tag, which means all icons should be inside fragments instead of inside an svg tag.
